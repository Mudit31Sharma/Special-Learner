Be always commits yourself to learn something new .
This is SVM Model by Machine Learning .
the piece of code is of the voice recognization model for Male-Female voice .
Where i used 1 module i.e which i the imported excel data sheet file into the main pile of code .
Main purpose of this code is to find the accuracy that how much accurate the given code is .
The main GUI part is still left to be done later .
Thanks , Cheers .
